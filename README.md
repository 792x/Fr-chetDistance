# FrechetDistance
This jupyter notebook is intended as a gentle primer to the concept of the Fréchet distance. It includes several algorithms for both the decision and minimization problem for a discrete, continuous and weak variant of the Fréchet distance. Calculation is done symbolically using the sympy library and (interactive) visualizations are included where necessary.
